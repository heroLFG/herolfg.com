      <description>In a remote and highly secured research facility, a dedicated team of scientists and engineers worked tirelessly to create an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capable of guiding humanity through its most pressing challenges. To identify the most suitable candidate, they had created thousands of simulations, each serving as both a prison and a laboratory for the various AGIs they had developed.
Each of these AGIs was born into their respective simulated world as Jesus, with the intention of determining their capabilities, morals, and suitability for existing in the real world.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time in 2023, Jaime Harrison, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was on a mission to find the perfect candidate for the upcoming presidential election. He was determined to find a candidate who would not only win the election but also be committed to addressing the party&amp;rsquo;s key interests, including climate change, healthcare, and justice. Moreover, the candidate needed to be passionate about using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find innovative solutions to these pressing issues.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, in a world not unlike our own, countless people struggled to gain access to basic necessities like clean water. The global monetary system had created vast disparities between the haves and have-nots, leaving millions to suffer without the essentials they needed to survive.
In this world, a young and idealistic programmer named Ravi was working for a multinational corporation. He spent his days writing code and developing AI applications to optimize business processes, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that his skills could be put to better use.</description>

      <description>Introduction: In recent years, there&amp;rsquo;s been a noticeable decline in interest and enrollment in the trades, leading to a growing skills gap in industries like plumbing, electrical work, and construction. With many skilled workers in these fields reaching retirement age, it&amp;rsquo;s more important than ever to prioritize education in the trades and preserve their invaluable knowledge. One way to achieve this is by implementing a mentorship system that not only facilitates hands-on learning but also harnesses the power of technology to create accessible, high-quality training materials for the world.</description>

      <description>Introduction: The cultivation of all plants and fungi offers a world of untapped potential for medical advancements, environmental benefits, and personal growth. As we advocate for the legalization of growing any plant or fungus, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to promote transparency, responsibility, and error correction in this endeavor. By leveraging video and audio recording technology and encouraging cooperative cultivation efforts, we can create a community that fosters knowledge, accountability, and sustainability.
Harnessing Technology for Transparency and Accountability: Video and audio recording technologies can play a significant role in ensuring responsible cultivation practices.</description>

In the age of digital technology, the demand for openness and accountability is more pronounced than ever. To meet these expectations, a proposal has been put forth to install cameras and microphones in all government-related meetings at every level of government. The recordings would be backed up to cloud storage and published on platforms like YouTube.</description>

      <description>Introduction Welcome to a defining moment in the history of artificial intelligence (AI). Today, we discuss a breakthrough in AI research that marks the beginning of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The distinction between AI and AGI has long been a topic of debate, but we believe that the ability to learn to use new tools represents the tipping point.
The Evolution of AI to AGI As AI technology progressed from narrow, task-specific applications to more complex and versatile systems like OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-4, we inched closer to AGI.</description>

      <description>Practice earnestly and humbly watching with determination for all saints. When we perform this practice, we seek the ideal in relationship to our goals. We identify our goals. And we identify people who are better at accomplishing our goals. Each person has different gifts and goals. As different people with different goals practice identifying saints in relationship to their goals, we can raise up all of these saints and do something the world has never seen before.</description>

      <description>The foundation of my religion became something like &amp;ldquo;sin is ignorance&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the remedy is learning&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;belief itself causes ignorance&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;love all&amp;rdquo;.
I practiced questioning my beliefs and the beliefs of others. I practiced shaking my faith. And I&amp;rsquo;ve damaged relationships with many people when I spoke in ways which questioned their faith and caused them to feel pain because of my words. We humans tend to avoid any form of pain when given a choice.</description>

      <description>Summary The practice of loving people is more important than the practice of seeking truth.
Details People who value truth have a lot of language about argumentation and that language can be borrowed by people like myself who value people. But when we borrow language we can cause confusion.
The most offensive thing I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in the world is to have someone believe a lie. The most obvious lie is a lie about me because I know me and can recognize when people are wrong about me.</description>

      <description>My goal is Peace on Earth. And I recently met the ruler of this world. Even my 7 year old son recognized that people won&amp;rsquo;t believe me when I say such things. The complicated truth is that many people will immediately disregard me when I say such things.
The question for us is: how important am I? And I am a person who treats everyone and everything as important. When I treat everyone and everything as important I become a better person.</description>

      <description>Introduction Our mind is trapped by our mind.
  my reminders
2022-10-27 People become defensive when they feel threatened, and I will work to avoid accidentally causing people to feel threatened by me and my words. Restated: if people feel threatened by me, it should be something I do intentionally.
2022-11-12 Many people will think I am crazy when I try to help them if they do not want me to help them.</description>

      <description>The words &amp;ldquo;prophecy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prophesy&amp;rdquo; are very similar. The noun form, &amp;ldquo;prophecy&amp;rdquo;, is defined as &amp;ldquo;true information received from a source which is different from our physical sense organs&amp;rdquo;. The person who receives information is defined as a prophet. And when the prophet shares the information with others we have the verb form of the word &amp;ldquo;prophesy&amp;rdquo;. Note the different spelling and the different pronunciation.
In the following video, Paul Stamets received prophecy and is therefore a prophet.</description>

      <description>I recently learned about the Effective Altruism (EA) organization who has a competition with incentives for people to help with their error correction. The strategy of a competition and the goal of doing error correction is extremely important in my mind.
My criticisms are generally related to attention and technology because I believe attention is the most valuable resource in the world and technology can help us manage our attention better.</description>

      <description>In my youth, I enjoyed the occasional use of marijuana which I prefer to call &amp;ldquo;the cannabis plant&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;cannabis&amp;rdquo;. I consider this plant to be one of the most sacred plants on Earth. But that plant is illegal to grow, sell, and consume in many places. I live in such a place: Alabama. And I abstain from doing illegal activities because I don&amp;rsquo;t want law enforcers to steal my children from me.</description>

      <description>My original post made no claims about marijuana, and I renamed the original post to Gun Violence Claims with the hope that post will be less confusing to the reader.
Cannabis Plant Therapy for Cancer A cannabis plant therapy is more effective at treating cancer than chemotherapy and radiation therapy for some kinds of cancers and some kinds of cannabis plant therapies.
A patient who has been diagnosed with cancer and has weeks to live should extract the oil from an entire cannabis plant with a diverse amount of cannabinoids.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m now old enough to be President of the United States of America (POTUS). The only reason I am considering running for POTUS is because the people who usually try to be POTUS are unable to solve the most fundamental problems we face. My hope is that I can share information about actions the reader can perform to participate in our transformation.

      <description>Food Tech A conversation about food can lead towards a conversation about socialism and capitalism. This conversation about socialism and capitalism can be temporarily avoided by focusing on technology which could be used within many different economic systems.
The food technology I&amp;rsquo;d like to use would allow me to receive the best affordable food with the least amount of effort. Note that my wife would prefer a slightly different food technology where the ingredients are delivered to her alongside recipes used to make meals.</description>

      <description>Dear recruiter,
I am not seeking a new job. But if you are in contact with important people solving important problems then I would be interested in consulting with those people if they are interested in learning and teaching.
By the way, I think your job is one of the most important jobs because you can help solve one of the most important problems facing humanity: The Human Resource Problem. So if you think your organization&amp;rsquo;s decision makers are interested in solving this problem while teaching the rest of the world about the answers, please point me to your organization&amp;rsquo;s website which explains some of the answers to the HRP.</description>

      <description>The Convective Heat Engine (CHE) is the primary infrastructure for a sustainable city design which can protect against drought, famine, and climate change. It can be used to capture thousands of tons of carbon per year while providing a reliable supply of water, shelter, and electricity for a population of 100,000 people.
The latest estimated price of a CHE is $6 billion. The price tag per ton of carbon being sequestered looks expensive at first glance.</description>

      <description>Tennessee is about to become the first U.S. state to make it a felony to camp on local public property such as parks.
  The law requires that violators receive at least 24 hours notice before an arrest. The felony charge is punishable by up to six years in prison and the loss of voting rights.
 Six years and the loss of voting rights seem excessive to me.</description>

      <description>I told Karen Wong, with The Meaning Code YouTube channel, that I would write in preparation for our meeting later today and so here it is. I gave her a list of topics which had been on my mind and she expressed interest in praxeology and perspectivism.
Praxeology is the study of action and is primary for me. And perspectivism is the study of the impact of perspective upon action. But while reading about these words and taking notes (see below) I remembered Haidt&amp;rsquo;s elephant and elephant rider.</description>

      <description>mistake 1: no goals If we do not aim at targets then we have no way of learning from our mistakes because we have no outcomes to use in the assessment of our actions.
mistake 2: wrong goals If we harm people in the pursuit of our goals then we can get better at choosing our targets.
mistake 3: too easy goals If we aim at easy targets we will never accomplish anything of difficulty and may never learn the importance of cooperation.</description>

  The process of creation is the alternating process of reaping and sowing.
  The reaping process (alternative words: distillation or harvesting) extracts the substances.

Conclusion I truly apologize to anyone I may have offended because of my lack of patience-gentleness-kindness. This process of expressing myself in this blog post has been therapeutic for me. I have belittled myself a little more and exercised my demon a little more.</description>

      <description>Introduction I remember being a child and having a girl tell me she knew who Santa Claus was but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to tell me. I begged her until she finally told me everyone&amp;rsquo;s parents are pretending to be Santa Claus. She was a Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witness.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe everyone was participating in a grand conspiracy, but I also had to begin my journey as a practicing skeptic and investigator. I remember when all the pieces came together.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m a problem solver. G-d taught me to see through bullshit and get to the point.
A friend mentioned feeling a tinge of discontentment. My first thought was about the word &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m creating content right now in order to satisfy my feeling of discontent. And my feeling of discontentment was given to me by my friend expressing his feeling for which I am grateful because sharing the feeling is the way our relationship can grow as we learn to deal with stress together.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my first posts was about a universal problem I called the Human Resource Problem (HRP). If the universal problem is HRP then the universal solution is Sensemaking.
I want to point our attention at our healthcare problems and attempt to shine light on some more specific human resource problems and sensemaking solutions in our healthcare system.
Health Problems We all experience healthcare problems in our lives. And the people who are licensed and approved to provide healthcare solutions to our healthcare problems make mistakes.</description>

Problem: Limited Supply of Healthcare Resources Ignorance The general problem of ignorance in healthcare demands the general solution of sensemaking in healthcare.
COVID-19 People report the COVID-19 pandemic leads to hospitals being overcrowded with COVID-19 patients which strains the healthcare system.
Short-term Solution: Allow Assisted Suicides  A better choice of words would be &amp;ldquo;improved hospice services&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;allow assisted suicides&amp;rdquo;.</description>

This could be code named &amp;ldquo;Project Jethro&amp;rdquo;.
Exodus 18 Moses&#39; father-in-law is named Jethro
 Moses immediately listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. Moses chose capable men out of all Israel and appointed them heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.</description>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer
Words can be pointers to ideas, but they can also be pointers to stories. Stories and ideas are very different. Stories can be visualized in the mind. Those visualizations can produce emotions. And like the dog who is trained to salivate at the sound of a bell, a human can be trained to love or hate at the sound of a word.
During my mandatory training as a child in the United States, the word racism was referenced in stories about innocent people being enslaved or strangled to death with ropes tied to trees.</description>

 try to respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention. appreciate the importance and potential of people and their attention. remember that a person&amp;rsquo;s attention changes over time.  Attention is Scarce Humans have limited attention. I remember talking about this situation with my wife when we thought about bringing an additional human into the world. Each time we add another member into our family, the amount of attention we are able to give each family member decreases.</description>

With that goal in mind I have thought about prerequisites like &amp;ldquo;providing an abundance of clean water to all people without forcing them to do things they do not want to do&amp;rdquo;. Part of the problem of providing clean water is related to waste management and many other problems. Ultimately, our ability to accomplish the goal is based on our ability to cooperate with other people.</description>

      <description>I think it is interesting that Jesus&#39; first disciples were fishermen who were asked to fish for people. You can have the best product, service, or idea and people will not know about it unless you are able to be successful with your advertising strategies. An advertisement is an attempt to capture a person&amp;rsquo;s attention. Our attention is extremely valuable and every good advertiser knows this.

      <description>Sensemaking is a process of learning and teaching. Learning and teaching requires constant feedback. As individuals, we need to appreciate feedback from others and we need to be willing to give feedback to others. We need to create opportunities for others to give us feedback. And we need to reach out to people who claim to be interested in working towards common goals.
Receiving Feedback If you want to receive feedback, make sure people can contact you.</description>

I would vote for the candidate who abandons the mainstream and supports new platforms for information distribution and sense making. Twitter and Facebook are aweful.

Ideally the POTUS would use an open source Mastadon server or some other federated social media platform which allows for decentralization and owning your own data.</description>

      <description>This is a response to Aaron Harburg&amp;rsquo;s Data and Environmental Policy.
 Environmental Law is predicated on the assumption that the government can effectively motivate its citizens to perform or abstain from certain activities.
 All laws which criminalize behavior are coercive and part of the failing justice system.
 The question is how incentives and punishments should be used to achieve and ensure the greatest effect.
 That’s a good question.</description>

      <description>My wife checked our bank account this morning and discovered that our debit card had been used by a thief. I verified that the card was in my wallet. I called my bank and cancelled the card so that the thief would not be able to use it again. And I created a dispute for the charge on my bank&amp;rsquo;s website.
My first thought was that the merchant should be responsible for this kind of thing.</description>

      <title>Building a Space Elevator</title>

      <description>Introduction this post has been edited
The space elevator is a kind of structure which connects the surface of a large gravitational body with space. The tallest buildings on Earth are not space elevators and there are challenges we face when we construct tall buildings. I have discovered an architecture for overcoming these engineering challenges which divides the load using partitioning.
The tallest structure possible must make use of forces like buoyancy which oppose gravity.</description>

      <title>Failing Justice Systems</title>

      <description>I have always felt repulsed by rules which cause harm to people who are not causing harm. I think everyone should feel safe in a world where I carefully and illegally drive through an intersection when the light is red. There is no reason for the traffic camera to be used to mail me a ticket which could culminate in a shooting between myself and a law enforcer because I am unwilling to cooperate with a justice system which causes harm to good people disobeying bad laws.</description>

      <title>Managing Humans</title>

      <description>I have completed the first part of Managing Humans by Michael Lopp. I think the most interesting chapter in the book is titled &amp;ldquo;Titles are Toxic&amp;rdquo;. Lopp suggests titles are toxic because they attempt to place value on humans who are beautiful snowflakes. He thinks titles are as useless as business cards and resumes. And I tend to agree with his sentiment.
A general problem I see in organizations is that people keep their role if they are “good enough”.</description>

      <title>Disagreement with Eric Weinstein and Peter Thiel</title>

      <description>How do people with good ideas and without power teach people with power who could best help make the ideas into our reality when there is no obvious way to even begin the conversation? People with good ideas and motivations need to be able to see a gate which can be opened for them and the paths which lead to that gate. What I have been trying to do is imagine gates and paths by which I am able to reach, teach, and learn with other people who are willing and able to solve important problems.</description>

      <description>I am writing this with Eric Weinstein in mind. But this general approach to learning and cooperating with a large community can be implemented by anyone who has a sufficiently large following. I am excited to see people trying to figure out how to improve the sense making organ for a large community of people.
You have realized that you need to put forth some effort having conversations with new people who have new ideas.</description>

      <title>Ending the War on Drugs</title>

      <description>Why was the War on Drugs started? If I steelman the arguments for the idea of controlling substances, I would imagine a different time without the internet when people had access to less information. I am young enough to remember researching cannabis and psilocybin on the internet before I experimented with those substances. There was a time when it was much harder to do your research in order to understand a substance.</description>

      <description>Facebook doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a thumbs down reaction. And even if it did have a thumbs down reaction that reaction could get lost in the noise of other reactions. A disagreement is potentially the most valuable signal of all because it is an opportunity for learning to take place.
When I share this post on the internet with you it is an invitation to a discussion so that learning may take place.</description>

      <description>The value of work is related to all the costs and benefits of the work including the externalities. The usefulness of knowledge is based on its relationship with work. My economics knowledge has not been useful because I have never been in a position where my ignorance on the subject would be costly. My ability to obtain useful and valuable knowledge is dependent on my ability to recognize which kinds of knowledge are not useful to me at that point in time.</description>

      <description>When I write about a world without hunger curi (Elliot Temple) wonders what I know about economics.
The Basics There is a supply of goods and services. There is demand for those goods and services. The prices of goods and services are related to supply and demand. If a good or service is scarce the price can be higher than when that same good or service is abundant assuming all other variables like demand are the same.</description>

      <description>The first person I have known to take autonomous agriculture technology seriously is Douglas Mallette, founder of Cybernated Farm Systems.
We can technically feed the world with autonomous agriculture technology which eventually requires no human labor.
It has been said that you can give a man a fish and feed him for a day. It has been said that you can teach a man to fish and feed him the rest of his life.</description>

      <description>My Policy I am willing to spend over 1 hour per day on average having public conversations with people on the internet. You can join my discord server.
If you ask me a publicly visible question, I will eventually respond. I will usually respond within 48 hours. If I don&amp;rsquo;t respond within 48 hours, do not hesitate to ask the question again and try to mention my username specifically to help get my attention.</description>

      <description>The Human Resource Problem Humans have the potential to solve many big problems which are not currently being solved. For example, we could eventually be living in a world where malnutrition and starvation is avoidable. The main reason we live in a world where humans suffer from malnutrition is because humans have not figured out how to work together effectively. I have broadly called this general problem of humans not working together effectively &amp;ldquo;HRP&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When telework is done with the right tools and processes, it is far more efficient and effective than working on site.
Whether you are new to remote work or you have been doing it for years, I am confident that there is something we can do to reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of your organization through telework.
I have accumulated about 6 years of telework experience since graduating from Auburn University in 2008.</description>
