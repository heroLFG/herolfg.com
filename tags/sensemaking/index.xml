Words can be pointers to ideas, but they can also be pointers to stories. Stories and ideas are very different. Stories can be visualized in the mind. Those visualizations can produce emotions. And like the dog who is trained to salivate at the sound of a bell, a human can be trained to love or hate at the sound of a word.
During my mandatory training as a child in the United States, the word racism was referenced in stories about innocent people being enslaved or strangled to death with ropes tied to trees.</description>

Popular people with good goals must:
 try to respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention. appreciate the importance and potential of people and their attention. remember that a person&amp;rsquo;s attention changes over time.  Attention is Scarce Humans have limited attention. I remember talking about this situation with my wife when we thought about bringing an additional human into the world. Each time we add another member into our family, the amount of attention we are able to give each family member decreases.</description>

My Goal My goal has been to help create peace on Earth. With that goal in mind I have thought about prerequisites like &amp;ldquo;providing an abundance of clean water to all people without forcing them to do things they do not want to do&amp;rdquo;. Part of the problem of providing clean water is related to waste management and many other problems. Ultimately, our ability to accomplish the goal is based on our ability to cooperate with other people.</description>

Introduction The authorities should not be trusted when they are not willing nor able to solve problems which make our world better. I have encountered evidence which indicates that FACEBOOK and Science Feedback are being misleading and should not be trusted to help solve important problems and make our world better.</description>

      <description>Supposedly there is this thing called &amp;ldquo;the meaning crisis&amp;rdquo; and many people are nihilists. Who knew? What does that even mean? Maybe I can help.
I believe the hell you are in is an opportunity to develop your stack of skills and try to become an important part of the story by which hell is transformed into heaven. I believe the smallest changes done with the right spirit can have the biggest impact as the chain of events ripple through space-time.</description>

      <title>Advertising is Fishing for People</title>

      <description>I think it is interesting that Jesus&amp;rsquo; first disciples were fishermen who were asked to fish for people. You can have the best product, service, or idea and people will not know about it unless you are able to be successful with your advertising strategies. An advertisement is an attempt to capture a person&amp;rsquo;s attention. Our attention is extremely valuable and every good advertiser knows this.

      <description>I will criticize an immoral Republican view and then I will criticize an immoral Democrat view. My morality assessments depend on whether or not a person&amp;rsquo;s behavior is in alignment with my ideology.
Introduction In a dream I am given a test. If everyone in the class picks the first choice then everyone gets a perfect score. But if anyone picks the second choice and does all the work then everyone who did the first choice will get half of a perfect score.</description>

      <title>The Christian</title>

      <description>There were mistakes in the original post and edits have been made. Please let me know if you find any mistakes.
 I am not convinced that being Christian is the best. My concern about Christians is that they are ultimately willing to sacrifice their life on Earth because their reward is in heaven. The Christian is at odds with the Anti-Christian who does not want to sacrifice their life on Earth because they do not believe their reward is in heaven.</description>

      <description>We humans let ideas and interpretations of words slip into our mind without thinking critically. And if we are not willing to question our beliefs then we remain stuck with ignorance and confusion. But if we question our beliefs then we have the opportunity to learn.</description>

      <title>How to be a Thought Leader</title>

      <description>“Bernays&amp;rsquo; thesis is that &amp;ldquo;invisible&amp;rdquo; people who create knowledge and propaganda rule over the masses, with a monopoly on the power to shape thoughts, values, and citizen response.” - Wikipedia
 In the current age of the internet, there is no longer a monopoly on the power to shape thoughts, values, and citizen response. Where there was once a monopoly there is now an oligarchy of thought leaders where each person in that oligarchy is a gatekeeper.</description>

      <title>Love and Sense Making</title>

      <description>Our malfunctioning sense making organ is the fundamental sickness we can all be trying to heal.
We can measure our love based on our attention. Our attention is fundamental to our sense making. And so our love and our sense making are related individually and collectively.
 Love everyone  Love by proximity Love by relevance Be honest.    Love everyone. One of my claims is that a properly functioning sense making organ should be loving and able to prioritize information based on its relevance.</description>
