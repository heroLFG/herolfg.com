      <description>In my youth, I enjoyed the occasional use of marijuana which I prefer to call &amp;ldquo;the cannabis plant&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;cannabis&amp;rdquo;. I consider this plant to be one of the most sacred plants on Earth. But that plant is illegal to grow, sell, and consume in many places. I live in such a place: Alabama. And I abstain from doing illegal activities because I don&amp;rsquo;t want law enforcers to steal my children from me.</description>
