      <description>Because most people don&amp;rsquo;t start at the end, I decided to re-arrange the content accordingly. If you reverse the order of the content you may notice how the exercise flows into the conclusion.
Conclusion I truly apologize to anyone I may have offended because of my lack of patience-gentleness-kindness. This process of expressing myself in this blog post has been therapeutic for me. I have belittled myself a little more and exercised my demon a little more.</description>

      <description>Introduction I remember being a child and having a girl tell me she knew who Santa Claus was but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to tell me. I begged her until she finally told me everyone&amp;rsquo;s parents are pretending to be Santa Claus. She was a Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witness.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe everyone was participating in a grand conspiracy, but I also had to begin my journey as a practicing skeptic and investigator. I remember when all the pieces came together.</description>
