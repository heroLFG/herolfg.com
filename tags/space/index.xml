      <description>Introduction this post has been edited
The space elevator is a kind of structure which connects the surface of a large gravitational body with space. The tallest buildings on Earth are not space elevators and there are challenges we face when we construct tall buildings. I have discovered an architecture for overcoming these engineering challenges which divides the load using partitioning.
The tallest structure possible must make use of forces like buoyancy which oppose gravity.</description>
