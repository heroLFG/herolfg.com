      <description>Food Tech A conversation about food can lead towards a conversation about socialism and capitalism. This conversation about socialism and capitalism can be temporarily avoided by focusing on technology which could be used within many different economic systems.
The food technology I&amp;rsquo;d like to use would allow me to receive the best affordable food with the least amount of effort. Note that my wife would prefer a slightly different food technology where the ingredients are delivered to her alongside recipes used to make meals.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m now old enough to be President of the United States of America (POTUS). The only reason I am considering running for POTUS is because the people who usually try to be POTUS are unable to solve the most fundamental problems we face. My hope is that I can share information about actions the reader can perform to participate in our transformation.
Corruption, Trustworthiness, and Funding We are all corrupted people to one degree or another deserving limited trustworthiness.</description>
