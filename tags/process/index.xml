      <description>Facebook doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a thumbs down reaction. And even if it did have a thumbs down reaction that reaction could get lost in the noise of other reactions. A disagreement is potentially the most valuable signal of all because it is an opportunity for learning to take place.
When I share this post on the internet with you it is an invitation to a discussion so that learning may take place.</description>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer practicing a relationship with the Greatest Intentions
Serious content should have version control with historical changes.
The Human Resource Problem Humans have the potential to solve many big problems which are not currently being solved. For example, we could eventually be living in a world where malnutrition and starvation is avoidable. The main reason we live in a world where humans suffer from malnutrition is because humans have not figured out how to work together effectively.</description>

      <description>When telework is done with the right tools and processes, it is far more efficient and effective than working on site.
Whether you are new to remote work or you have been doing it for years, I am confident that there is something we can do to reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of your organization through telework.
I have accumulated about 6 years of telework experience since graduating from Auburn University in 2008.</description>
