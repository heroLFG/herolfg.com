      <description>Dear recruiter,
I am not seeking a new job. But if you are in contact with important people solving important problems then I would be interested in consulting with those people if they are interested in learning and teaching.
By the way, I think your job is one of the most important jobs because you can help solve one of the most important problems facing humanity: The Human Resource Problem. So if you think your organization&amp;rsquo;s decision makers are interested in solving this problem while teaching the rest of the world about the answers, please point me to your organization&amp;rsquo;s website which explains some of the answers to the HRP.</description>

      <title>Disagreement</title>

      <description>Facebook doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a thumbs down reaction. And even if it did have a thumbs down reaction that reaction could get lost in the noise of other reactions. A disagreement is potentially the most valuable signal of all because it is an opportunity for learning to take place.
When I share this post on the internet with you it is an invitation to a discussion so that learning may take place.</description>

      <description>My Policy I am willing to spend over 1 hour per day on average having public conversations with people on the internet. You can join my discord server.
If you ask me a publicly visible question, I will eventually respond. I will usually respond within 48 hours. If I don&amp;rsquo;t respond within 48 hours, do not hesitate to ask the question again and try to mention my username specifically to help get my attention.</description>

      <title>Human Resource Problem</title>

      <description>The Human Resource Problem Humans have the potential to solve many big problems which are not currently being solved. For example, we could eventually be living in a world where malnutrition and starvation is avoidable. The main reason we live in a world where humans suffer from malnutrition is because humans have not figured out how to work together effectively. I have broadly called this general problem of humans not working together effectively &amp;ldquo;HRP&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When telework is done with the right tools and processes, it is far more efficient and effective than working on site.
Whether you are new to remote work or you have been doing it for years, I am confident that there is something we can do to reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of your organization through telework.
I have accumulated about 6 years of telework experience since graduating from Auburn University in 2008.</description>
