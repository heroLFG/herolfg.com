      <description>Introduction Many people want to own their data and the algorithms which are used when engaging with other people on the internet. I mentioned this idea to a friend and he introduced me to Mastadon. I soon learned about activity pub and the fediverse.
I started thinking about how I want to use activity pub. I could join an existing Mastadon community or I could host my own server. I could also look at other open source projects which leverage activity pub.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking about who I should vote for POTUS in 2020.
I would vote for the candidate who abandons the mainstream and supports new platforms for information distribution and sense making. Twitter and Facebook are aweful. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think the candidate should just go over to Parler. Ideally the POTUS would use an open source Mastadon server or some other federated social media platform which allows for decentralization and owning your own data.</description>
