      <description>Once upon a time in 2023, Jaime Harrison, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was on a mission to find the perfect candidate for the upcoming presidential election. He was determined to find a candidate who would not only win the election but also be committed to addressing the party&amp;rsquo;s key interests, including climate change, healthcare, and justice. Moreover, the candidate needed to be passionate about using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find innovative solutions to these pressing issues.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time in 2023, Ronna McDaniel, the Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, was on a mission to find the ideal candidate for the upcoming presidential election. She was determined to find a candidate who would not only win the election but also be willing and able to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to combat corruption and waste in government, which had plagued all large governments since the dawn of time.</description>

      <description>Introduction The quest for government transparency has always been a vital part of any democratic society. In the age of digital technology, the demand for openness and accountability is more pronounced than ever. To meet these expectations, a proposal has been put forth to install cameras and microphones in all government-related meetings at every level of government. The recordings would be backed up to cloud storage and published on platforms like YouTube.</description>

      <title>Homelessness Becomes a Felony</title>

      <description>Tennessee is about to become the first U.S. state to make it a felony to camp on local public property such as parks.
  The law requires that violators receive at least 24 hours notice before an arrest. The felony charge is punishable by up to six years in prison and the loss of voting rights.
 Six years and the loss of voting rights seem excessive to me.</description>

      <description>Abstract Summary The monsters are within us. The battle starts within and never ends.
Introduction We get to figure this out together and create peace on Earth as we solve the biggest problem and embody the best answer.
Trained Responses We often respond to stimuli like Pavlov&amp;rsquo;s dog who was trained to salivate at the sound of a bell but we do it with words. This is the mindless zombie within us who does not want to change our views.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my first posts was about a universal problem I called the Human Resource Problem (HRP). If the universal problem is HRP then the universal solution is Sensemaking.
I want to point our attention at our healthcare problems and attempt to shine light on some more specific human resource problems and sensemaking solutions in our healthcare system.
Health Problems We all experience healthcare problems in our lives. And the people who are licensed and approved to provide healthcare solutions to our healthcare problems make mistakes.</description>

Serious content should have version control with historical changes.
Problem: Limited Supply of Healthcare Resources Ignorance The general problem of ignorance in healthcare demands the general solution of sensemaking in healthcare.
COVID-19 People report the COVID-19 pandemic leads to hospitals being overcrowded with COVID-19 patients which strains the healthcare system.
Short-term Solution: Allow Assisted Suicides  A better choice of words would be &amp;ldquo;improved hospice services&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;allow assisted suicides&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer practicing a relationship with the Greatest Intentions
Serious content should have version control with historical changes.
 What are my goals?  I learn. I give intent. I invite feedback. I give progress. I give outcomes. I seek peace.    What is government? Government is a system which has inputs, outputs, functions, and goals.
What is government corruption? The perception of government corruption emerges when people disagree with government activities.</description>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer practicing a relationship with the Greatest Intentions
The energy I invest in this thought space is dedicated toward serving the greatest intentions. This ultimately means I am willing to put myself in service to others with my energy.
The process of creating peace on Earth and solving the Human Resource Problem is directly related to increasing people&amp;rsquo;s attention to the right ideas. One such idea is platforming.</description>

      <description>This post has had changes.
When our work is recorded and shared with the world we are facilitating the same education process which happens when open source software engineers build tools you are using to read this post right now.
Transparency By the end of this post, I will begin explaining new ways of implementing limited transparency into society.
If enough work is done in the full light of transparency technologies, we would end world hunger and all threats of war within 30 years.</description>

      <title>Data and Environmental Policy Response</title>

      <description>This is a response to Aaron Harburg&amp;rsquo;s Data and Environmental Policy.
 Environmental Law is predicated on the assumption that the government can effectively motivate its citizens to perform or abstain from certain activities.
 All laws which criminalize behavior are coercive and part of the failing justice system.
 The question is how incentives and punishments should be used to achieve and ensure the greatest effect.
 That’s a good question.</description>

      <description>What is religion? I like the meaning of the word religion which corresponds with the idea that Jordan Peterson introduced me to regarding our actions. When asked if he believes in God, he responds that he lives his life as if God exists. I think our actions are the essential part of our religious belief. I think it was the Christian James who taught faith without works is dead. I think our work is vital and defines our religion.</description>
