      <description>When our work is recorded and shared with the world we are facilitating the same education process which happens when open source software engineers build tools you are using to read this post right now.
Transparency By the end of this post, I will begin explaining new ways of integrating transparency into society.

      <description>This is a response to Aaron Harburg&amp;rsquo;s Data and Environmental Policy.
 Environmental Law is predicated on the assumption that the government can effectively motivate its citizens to perform or abstain from certain activities.
 All laws which criminalize behavior are coercive and part of the failing justice system.
 The question is how incentives and punishments should be used to achieve and ensure the greatest effect.
 Thatâ€™s a good question.</description>

      <description>What is religion? I like the meaning of the word religion which corresponds with the idea that Jordan Peterson introduced me to regarding our actions. When asked if he believes in God, he responds that he lives his life as if God exists. I think our actions are the essential part of our religious belief. I think it was the Christian James who taught faith without works is dead. I think our work is vital and defines our religion.</description>
