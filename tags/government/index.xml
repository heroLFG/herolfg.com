Serious content should have version control with historical changes.
Problem: Limited Supply of Healthcare Resources People report the COVID-19 pandemic leads to hospitals being overcrowded with COVID-19 patients which strains the healthcare system.
Short-term Solution: Allow Assisted Suicides  A better choice of words would be &amp;ldquo;improved hospice services&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;allow assisted suicides&amp;rdquo;. People responded in a predictable way to my suggestion that assisted suicides would improve our healthcare system.</description>

Serious content should have version control with historical changes.
 What are my goals?  I learn. I give intent. I invite feedback. I give progress. I give outcomes. I seek peace.    What is government? Government is a system which has inputs, outputs, functions, and goals.
What is government corruption? The perception of government corruption emerges when people disagree with government activities.</description>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer practicing a relationship with the Greatest Intentions
The energy I invest in this thought space is dedicated toward serving the greatest intentions. This ultimately means I am willing to put myself in service to others with my energy.
The process of creating peace on Earth and solving the Human Resource Problem is directly related to increasing people&amp;rsquo;s attention to the right ideas. One such idea is platforming.</description>

      <description>This post has had changes.
When our work is recorded and shared with the world we are facilitating the same education process which happens when open source software engineers build tools you are using to read this post right now.
Transparency By the end of this post, I will begin explaining new ways of implementing limited transparency into society.
If enough work is done in the full light of transparency technologies, we would end world hunger and all threats of war within 30 years.</description>

      <title>Data and Environmental Policy Response</title>

      <description>This is a response to Aaron Harburg&amp;rsquo;s Data and Environmental Policy.
 Environmental Law is predicated on the assumption that the government can effectively motivate its citizens to perform or abstain from certain activities.
 All laws which criminalize behavior are coercive and part of the failing justice system.
 The question is how incentives and punishments should be used to achieve and ensure the greatest effect.
 Thatâ€™s a good question.</description>

      <description>What is religion? I like the meaning of the word religion which corresponds with the idea that Jordan Peterson introduced me to regarding our actions. When asked if he believes in God, he responds that he lives his life as if God exists. I think our actions are the essential part of our religious belief. I think it was the Christian James who taught faith without works is dead. I think our work is vital and defines our religion.</description>
