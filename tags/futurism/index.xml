      <description>After many years of trying to find a group to help, I was introduced to Jacob Faturechi who shared an experimental idea to fix distributed cognition (or cognitive outsourcing). We call it crowdsource mail.
This could be code named &amp;ldquo;Project Jethro&amp;rdquo;.
Exodus 18 Moses&#39; father-in-law is named Jethro
 Moses immediately listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. Moses chose capable men out of all Israel and appointed them heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.</description>

      <description>This post has had changes.
When our work is recorded and shared with the world we are facilitating the same education process which happens when open source software engineers build tools you are using to read this post right now.

      <description>The thing we should do now is improve our election system and have another election in those areas where witnesses have reported illegal activity.
 I heard someone say &amp;ldquo;There is no proof of election fraud and even if there was election fraud against Donald Trump it would be a good thing.&amp;rdquo; This captures much of the sentiment of people who wanted to see Donald Trump lose in 2020. And it is not hard to believe that people tried to cheat in order to defeat Donald Trump.</description>
