      <description>On October 12, 2023 I decided to start practicing making Jesus my king.
I had previously defined a Christian this way.
 A Christian is a person who attempts to be like Christ: a king of kings. reference
 The most salient points about Jesus for me now.
 Love God with all your heart, mind, and soul. Love your neighbor as yourself. Love everyone up to and including your enemies.</description>

      <description>What if I told you that we are, each one of us, potent magicians wielding an immensely powerful tool? That every word we express is, indeed, a spell we cast out into the universe? This notion might seem fantastical at first glance, but when we delve deeper into the essence of language, we might begin to see the compelling resonance of truth in this perspective.
In the beginning, there was the Word.</description>

      <description>As we move towards an increasingly interconnected and global society, we also grapple with the question of how our systems of governance should evolve. One compelling vision draws inspiration from both ancient spiritual wisdom and cutting-edge technology: the governance of the New Jerusalem.
In this envisioned model, the government of New Jerusalem is a representative system, where decision-making bodies consist of individuals who embody not just expertise, but also virtues of the heart - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, self-control, goodness, and faithfulness.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what goes on in the minds of those who make crucial decisions that impact our lives every day? What if we had a way to ensure that those in power were making choices from a place of love, kindness, and self-control? Introducing the &amp;ldquo;Seal of God&amp;rdquo; device, a groundbreaking technology designed to provide unparalleled transparency into the mental and emotional states of individuals as they navigate the complexities of life.</description>

      <description>In my youth, I enjoyed the occasional use of marijuana which I prefer to call &amp;ldquo;the cannabis plant&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;cannabis&amp;rdquo;. I consider this plant to be one of the most sacred plants on Earth. But that plant is illegal to grow, sell, and consume in many places. I live in such a place: Alabama. And I abstain from doing illegal activities because I don&amp;rsquo;t want law enforcers to steal my children from me.</description>

      <description>My original post made no claims about marijuana, and I renamed the original post to Gun Violence Claims with the hope that post will be less confusing to the reader.
Cannabis Plant Therapy for Cancer A cannabis plant therapy is more effective at treating cancer than chemotherapy and radiation therapy for some kinds of cancers and some kinds of cannabis plant therapies.
A patient who has been diagnosed with cancer and has weeks to live should extract the oil from an entire cannabis plant with a diverse amount of cannabinoids.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m now old enough to be President of the United States of America (POTUS). The only reason I am considering running for POTUS is because the people who usually try to be POTUS are unable to solve the most fundamental problems we face. My hope is that I can share information about actions the reader can perform to participate in our transformation.
Corruption, Trustworthiness, and Funding We are all corrupted people to one degree or another deserving limited trustworthiness.</description>

      <description>Food Tech A conversation about food can lead towards a conversation about socialism and capitalism. This conversation about socialism and capitalism can be temporarily avoided by focusing on technology which could be used within many different economic systems.
The food technology I&amp;rsquo;d like to use would allow me to receive the best affordable food with the least amount of effort. Note that my wife would prefer a slightly different food technology where the ingredients are delivered to her alongside recipes used to make meals.</description>

      <description>This post has had changes.
When our work is recorded and shared with the world we are facilitating the same education process which happens when open source software engineers build tools you are using to read this post right now.
Transparency By the end of this post, I will begin explaining new ways of implementing limited transparency into society.
If enough work is done in the full light of transparency technologies, we would end world hunger and all threats of war within 30 years.</description>

      <description>Every time I am about to share information with other people I can transform that information into a blog post like I am doing now. When I create a blog post, I get to own my content and control my content. I can then share a link to my post on all of my social media networks. I can also update my blog post so that all of the links I shared get updated as well.</description>

      <title>Using Words For Good</title>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer
Words can be pointers to ideas, but they can also be pointers to stories. Stories and ideas are very different. Stories can be visualized in the mind. Those visualizations can produce emotions. And like the dog who is trained to salivate at the sound of a bell, a human can be trained to love or hate at the sound of a word.
During my mandatory training as a child in the United States, the word racism was referenced in stories about innocent people being enslaved or strangled to death with ropes tied to trees.</description>

Popular people with good goals must:
 try to respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention. appreciate the importance and potential of people and their attention. remember that a person&amp;rsquo;s attention changes over time.  Attention is Scarce Humans have limited attention. I remember talking about this situation with my wife when we thought about bringing an additional human into the world. Each time we add another member into our family, the amount of attention we are able to give each family member decreases.</description>

My Goal My goal has been to help create peace on Earth. With that goal in mind I have thought about prerequisites like &amp;ldquo;providing an abundance of clean water to all people without forcing them to do things they do not want to do&amp;rdquo;. Part of the problem of providing clean water is related to waste management and many other problems. Ultimately, our ability to accomplish the goal is based on our ability to cooperate with other people.</description>

      <title>How to do Sensemaking</title>
      <link>https://herolfg.com/posts/how-to-do-sensemaking/</link>

      <guid>https://herolfg.com/posts/how-to-do-sensemaking/</guid>
      <description>Sensemaking is a process of learning and teaching. Learning and teaching requires constant feedback. As individuals, we need to appreciate feedback from others and we need to be willing to give feedback to others. We need to create opportunities for others to give us feedback. And we need to reach out to people who claim to be interested in working towards common goals.
Receiving Feedback If you want to receive feedback, make sure people can contact you.</description>

      <description>The truth is that very few people are correct in their ideology because they do not understand human nature and our universal fallibility.
 I was a utilitarian when I was young. This means that I believed the means justify the ends. I would tell a lie if I could justify it. But I also know that I believed things which were wrong. I believed I had discovered a perpetual energy design.</description>

      <description>The thing we should do now is improve our election system and have another election in those areas where witnesses have reported illegal activity.
 I heard someone say &amp;ldquo;There is no proof of election fraud and even if there was election fraud against Donald Trump it would be a good thing.&amp;rdquo; This captures much of the sentiment of people who wanted to see Donald Trump lose in 2020. And it is not hard to believe that people tried to cheat in order to defeat Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>as of 10/01/2021, I identify as a Christian   There were mistakes in the original post and edits have been made. Please let me know if you find any mistakes.
 I am not convinced that being Christian is the best. My concern about Christians is that they are ultimately willing to sacrifice their life on Earth because their reward is in heaven. The Christian is at odds with the Anti-Christian who does not want to sacrifice their life on Earth because they do not believe their reward is in heaven.</description>

      <description>Our malfunctioning sense making organ is the fundamental sickness we can all be trying to heal.
We can measure our love based on our attention. Our attention is fundamental to our sense making. And so our love and our sense making are related individually and collectively.
 Love everyone  Love by proximity Love by relevance Be honest.    Love everyone. One of my claims is that a properly functioning sense making organ should be loving and able to prioritize information based on its relevance.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking about who I should vote for POTUS in 2020.
I would vote for the candidate who abandons the mainstream and supports new platforms for information distribution and sense making. Twitter and Facebook are aweful. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think the candidate should just go over to Parler. Ideally the POTUS would use an open source Mastadon server or some other federated social media platform which allows for decentralization and owning your own data.</description>
