      <description>Introduction I remember being a child and having a girl tell me she knew who Santa Claus was but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to tell me. I begged her until she finally told me everyone&amp;rsquo;s parents are pretending to be Santa Claus. She was a Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witness.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe everyone was participating in a grand conspiracy, but I also had to begin my journey as a practicing skeptic and investigator. I remember when all the pieces came together.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is an invitation to practice minerval arts with me or anyone you can find who is willing to participate. Minerval arts is a friendly battle of minds and ideas with an ultimate goal of increasing awareness for the practitioners and observers. If everyone practiced and appreciated minerval arts we would have our best chance at peace on Earth because we would have our best chance at optimally informed decision making.</description>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer practicing a relationship with the Greatest Intentions
Serious content should have version control with historical changes.
Introduction My intent is to identify the ideal scenario. I realize that our present is not ideal and we should work towards the ideal incrementally.
My claim is that there are certain individuals who are so spiritually mature that they could have their lives recorded and streamed to the world as evidence of their righteousness and qualification as the elect leaders of our world.</description>

      <description>Every time I am about to share information with other people I can transform that information into a blog post like I am doing now. When I create a blog post, I get to own my content and control my content. I can then share a link to my post on all of my social media networks. I can also update my blog post so that all of the links I shared get updated as well.</description>

      <title>Using Words For Good</title>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer
Words can be pointers to ideas, but they can also be pointers to stories. Stories and ideas are very different. Stories can be visualized in the mind. Those visualizations can produce emotions. And like the dog who is trained to salivate at the sound of a bell, a human can be trained to love or hate at the sound of a word.
During my mandatory training as a child in the United States, the word racism was referenced in stories about innocent people being enslaved or strangled to death with ropes tied to trees.</description>

      <title>My Attention</title>

      <description>Written by Gavin Palmer
Popular people with good goals must:
 try to respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention. appreciate the importance and potential of people and their attention. remember that a person&amp;rsquo;s attention changes over time.  Attention is Scarce Humans have limited attention. I remember talking about this situation with my wife when we thought about bringing an additional human into the world. Each time we add another member into our family, the amount of attention we are able to give each family member decreases.</description>

      <title>Advertising is Fishing for People</title>
      <link>https://herolfg.com/posts/advertising-is-fishing-for-people/</link>

      <description>I think it is interesting that Jesus&#39; first disciples were fishermen who were asked to fish for people. You can have the best product, service, or idea and people will not know about it unless you are able to be successful with your advertising strategies. An advertisement is an attempt to capture a person&amp;rsquo;s attention. Our attention is extremely valuable and every good advertiser knows this.
As a software engineer in organizations which must protect information, I have done security training which taught me how to avoid becoming an attack vector within an organization.</description>

      <title>Love and Sense Making</title>
      <link>https://herolfg.com/posts/love-and-sense-making/</link>

      <description>Our malfunctioning sense making organ is the fundamental sickness we can all be trying to heal.
We can measure our love based on our attention. Our attention is fundamental to our sense making. And so our love and our sense making are related individually and collectively.
 Love everyone  Love by proximity Love by relevance Be honest.    Love everyone. One of my claims is that a properly functioning sense making organ should be loving and able to prioritize information based on its relevance.</description>

      <title>Ending the War on Drugs</title>

      <description>Why was the War on Drugs started? If I steelman the arguments for the idea of controlling substances, I would imagine a different time without the internet when people had access to less information. I am young enough to remember researching cannabis and psilocybin on the internet before I experimented with those substances. There was a time when it was much harder to do your research in order to understand a substance.</description>

My Policy I am willing to spend over 1 hour per day on average having public conversations with people on the internet. You can join my discord server. I plan on helping to build a better discussion plugin for this site instead of disqus and recommend against using disqus for now.</description>
