      <description>I want to welcome Thaddeus Russell and thank him for engaging with me while I practice minerval arts.
Thad has created Renegade University where he offers different stories and explanations about history. Thad hosts a private facebook group for the people who are enrolled in Renegade University. Thad hosts the Unregistered Podcast. And Thad has written A Renegade History of the United States.
A reason I invited Thad to participate in conversations is because I see in him a person who has developed great skill at being skeptical.</description>
