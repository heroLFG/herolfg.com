      <description>Humans have the potential to solve many big problems which are not currently being solved.

The main reason we live in a world where humans suffer from malnutrition is because humans have not figured out how to work together effectively. I have broadly called this general problem of humans not working together effectively &amp;ldquo;HRP&amp;rdquo;.</description>
