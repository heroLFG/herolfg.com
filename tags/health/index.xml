      <description>Abstract Summary The monsters are within us. The battle starts within and never ends.
Introduction We get to figure this out together and create peace on Earth as we solve the biggest problem and embody the best answer.
Trained Responses We often respond to stimuli like Pavlov&amp;rsquo;s dog who was trained to salivate at the sound of a bell but we do it with words. This is the mindless zombie within us who does not want to change our views.</description>

      <description>Every time I am about to share information with other people I can transform that information into a blog post like I am doing now. When I create a blog post, I get to own my content and control my content. I can then share a link to my post on all of my social media networks. I can also update my blog post so that all of the links I shared get updated as well.</description>
