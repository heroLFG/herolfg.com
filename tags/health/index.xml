      <description>Abstract Summary The monsters are within us. The battle starts within and never ends.

      <description>Every time I am about to share information with other people I can transform that information into a blog post like I am doing now. When I create a blog post, I get to own my content and control my content. I can then share a link to my post on all of my social media networks. I can also update my blog post so that all of the links I shared get updated as well.</description>
