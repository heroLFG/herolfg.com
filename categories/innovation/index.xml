      <description>This is a response to Aaron Harburg&amp;rsquo;s Data and Environmental Policy.
 Environmental Law is predicated on the assumption that the government can effectively motivate its citizens to perform or abstain from certain activities.
 All laws which criminalize behavior are coercive and part of the failing justice system.
 The question is how incentives and punishments should be used to achieve and ensure the greatest effect.
 Thatâ€™s a good question.</description>

      <description>My wife checked our bank account this morning and discovered that our debit card had been used by a thief. I verified that the card was in my wallet. I called my bank and cancelled the card so that the thief would not be able to use it again. And I created a dispute for the charge on my bank&amp;rsquo;s website.
My first thought was that the merchant should be responsible for this kind of thing.</description>

      <description>Introduction this post has been edited
The space elevator is a kind of structure which connects the surface of a large gravitational body with space. The tallest buildings on Earth are not space elevators and there are challenges we face when we construct tall buildings. I have discovered an architecture for overcoming these engineering challenges which divides the load using partitioning.
The tallest structure possible must make use of forces like buoyancy which oppose gravity.</description>
