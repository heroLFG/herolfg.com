      <description>My wife checked our bank account this morning and discovered that our debit card had been used by a thief. I verified that the card was in my wallet. I called my bank and cancelled the card so that the thief would not be able to use it again. And I created a dispute for the charge on my bank&amp;rsquo;s website.
My first thought was that the merchant should be responsible for this kind of thing.</description>
