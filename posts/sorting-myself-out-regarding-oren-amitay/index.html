<h1 id="acknowledgement-tcp-protocol">Acknowledgement (TCP protocol)</h1>
<ul>
<li>My wife helps me so much.  She is amazing.  I appreciate her so much.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be superficial - think critically - question beliefs.  This is what attracted my wife to me.</li>
<li>My wife asks me - what good are you doing?</li>
<li>Magnesium helped me.  My wife discovered magnesium for me.</li>
<li>Dreams have helped me.  I think I learned empathy in a dream.  I thought the feeling of unconditional love was nirvana.</li>
<li>Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</li>
<li>We can create our own story.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="oren">Oren</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mention the word compassion or love even though he is called &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; and all of the diagnosis for mental health problems are related to love either directly or indirectly. - Gavin</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He talks about laws related to diagnosing people.
<ul>
<li>Laws which prevent practicing medicine without a license.</li>
<li>Laws which restrict the way a doctor practices medicine.</li>
<li>Ultimately - I uphold compassion and education.
<ul>
<li><strong>Is it compassionate to allow someone to kill themselves?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He talks about conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact.  The facts can be true but how do you connect the dots?
<ul>
<li>I started seeing conspiracy theories on a more practical level by remembering what my wife asked me - what good are you doing?</li>
<li>If believing in the story helps produce good then it is a good story.  Religious people have a story - a conspiracy theory.</li>
<li><strong>What is a good story that we can imagine together?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He talks about someone jumping off a balcony but the family said the police pushed her.
<ul>
<li>This is a case where people are quick to believe a story and they aren&rsquo;t thinking about whether or not the belief produces good outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;true true&rdquo; is a story that is true and good.</strong>  It would be true to Jordan Peterson and to Sam Harris.  They use the word in different ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He is OK living in uncertainty and he will do his best if there is something he can do to help.
<ul>
<li>I have a similar view.  But there is an important question.</li>
<li><strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the story we are creating?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He talks about nobody being a stay at home parent.
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t have a stay at home parent.</li>
<li><strong>The more important issue is whether or not the parent is listening to their child and how often.</strong>  Many parents do not listen to their child and live a superficial life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When his child looks up his child will see him looking into their eyes - not on a screen.
<ul>
<li>When I looked up, my parents weren&rsquo;t there.  My father wanted to raise me so that I didn&rsquo;t get disappointed if I was doing good work and nobody was watching.</li>
<li><strong>Do good work even if nobody acknowledges it.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He got in trouble on Twitter for using the wrong words.
<ul>
<li>I have not punished my children for using the wrong words.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t plan on punishing my children for using the wrong words.</li>
<li><strong>I teach my children about the risk of using the wrong words in our sick world.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So many people&rsquo;s problems start because they don&rsquo;t feel part of a group.
<ul>
<li>But he wore &ldquo;being the other&rdquo; as a &ldquo;badge of honor&rdquo;.</li>
<li>I do enjoy the privilege of having family and friends that I can ask for help.</li>
<li>I try to be a person that others can ask for help.  But I also try to be careful about this.
<ul>
<li><strong>I am a helper and a volunteer.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grizwald">Grizwald</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grizwald talks about QAnon and how they view Trump as a hero.
<ul>
<li>I believe I would be a better leader than Trump.</li>
<li>The danger of a hero is the idea that you can forfeit personal responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grizwald says there is nothing for young men to aspire to in our society anymore.
<ul>
<li><strong>We need to recruit people who want to be a part of the story which we imagine together.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grizwald says he goes and plays NPC for 8 hours a day.
<ul>
<li><strong>When I do my job - I am developing my skills stack.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grizwald says when there are people in your life that you can touch - touch them - give them a hug.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Everybody needs to hug somebody - at least once a day&rdquo; - Franti</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grizwald hopes we will try communes.
<ul>
<li>Oren says communes fail after a certain number of people.  If you can contain size and select who is in it then it can work.  Oren speaks against narcissists and psychopaths - you don&rsquo;t want them in your commune.</li>
<li>We can build intentional communities.  But we need to figure out the process by which we do hiring, firing, promotion, and demotion.  The human resource problem is real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grizwald says ready player one is a dystopian nightmare world.
<ul>
<li>For some people it is not.</li>
<li>We can imagine the technology used for good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grizwald says challenging the orthodoxy puts your job and livelihood at risk.
<ul>
<li>There are tactics and strategies which we can learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>People are trying to find some kind of purpose or meaning.
<ul>
<li><strong>What good are you doing?</strong></li>
<li>We must learn with others.</li>
<li>We must solve problems.</li>
<li>Some projects are better than others.
<ul>
<li>Missile Defense</li>
<li>Particle colliders</li>
<li>Space elevators</li>
<li>Ending hunger</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find something you can control and maintain your relationships.
<ul>
<li>Some people need a garden.</li>
<li>Be willing to have disagreements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to believe someone has your back.
<ul>
<li>I disagree.</li>
<li>We need mutually beneficial relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mouse utopia experiments may warn us about some ideas.
<ul>
<li>The struggle and challenge is good.</li>
<li>Life without challenge is meaningless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The issue of women entering the workforce.
<ul>
<li>I was raised by a single father.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turn off screens and share a meal with your family.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes people aren&rsquo;t present even though there is no screen.</li>
<li>People need a growth mindset founded on compassion (the holy spirit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
