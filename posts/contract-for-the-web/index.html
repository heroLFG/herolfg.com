        <p>I think <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> and I agree that we should try to use technology to help as many people as possible.  And my impression is that he has done good work with his mind.  I just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdyrjxa00DE">The World Wide Web - A Mid-Course Correction</a> where Tim recommends a <a href="https://contractfortheweb.org/">contract for the web</a>.</p>
<p>My hope was that Tim would be interested in a web where people may choose to sacrifice their anyonymity.  The reason we have <a href="https://herolfg.com/posts/cheating-in-elections">cheating in elections</a> is because we try too hard to provide anonymity to people who don&rsquo;t want it.  We need systems which provide anonymity to those who want anonymity and allows people to sacrifice their anonymity if they wish to experience the benefits of doing so.  This is the foundation of the web I want to see and if you start with these goals then you can arrive at a different set of principles which has much less risk in my opinion.</p>
<p>The contract for the web has 9 principles.  I think the principles they have listed are in the wrong order.</p>

<h2 id="fight-for-the-web">Fight for the Web</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Fight for the Web: So the Web remains open and a global public resource for people everywhere, now and in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We agree that we should oppose the web&rsquo;s weaponization, but I am concerned that things like this contract will be weaponized because it starts with the wrong goals and does not have the ideal hierarchy of values as indicated by the principles identified and the order in which they are published.</p>
<h2 id="build-strong-communities-that-respect-civil-discourse-and-human-dignity">Build strong communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity</h2>
<p>I agree that we need strong communities that respsect civil discourse.  I don&rsquo;t know what is meant by &ldquo;human dignity&rdquo;.  Many people I know have created a scapegoat in their mind about some person or group being responsible for the problems with communities and discourse.  But those very people will ignore me because I have not agreed with them.  The only way we can have strong communities that respect civil discourse is to take personal responsibility in our lives and avoid scapegoating.  Every individual needs to learn how to have conversations with people who <a href="https://herolfg.com/posts/disagreement">disagree</a> to facilitate true diversity and opportunity to learn.  I invite Tim to have a conversation with me about my thoughts and our disagreements.</p>
<p>The contract for the web talks about amplifying messages of systematically excluded groups.  But I don&rsquo;t know what is meant by &ldquo;systematically excluded groups&rdquo;.  Most people are excluded by the powers that be.  I mean over 99% of the population is being excluded.  And I believe that the signal among the noise of information on the web which should be amplified is the messages which claim to be able to solve the problems which will reduce the most suffering.  I claim that my messages could be amplified in order to reduce much suffering.  And I claim that I am in a large group of people who are not invited to speak with the powers that be.  I am actually ignored by the powers that be every time I try to connect with them.  And so the internet must allow people like me to sacrifice my anonymity in order to demonstrate that I am different than the bots or the people who fear others.  I have credentials and I can do well on any test.  We should recognize the individuals who have the courage and capacity to fight for the web.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>I think the contract for the web is based in an ideology with big mistakes.  Because my ideology causes me to prioritize the last principles in their contract for the web I suspect that the people who created the contract for the web would not be willing to have civil discourse with me.  I do not agree with all of the previous principles which they have prioritized.  The contract for the web and Tim Berners-Lee fail to do good root cause analysis regarding the problems we face and the solutions which could be used in the web to solve those problems.</p>
