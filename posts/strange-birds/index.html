        <p>Because most people don&rsquo;t start at the end, I decided to re-arrange the content accordingly.  If you reverse the order of the content you may notice how the exercise flows into the conclusion.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I truly apologize to anyone I may have offended because of my lack of patience-gentleness-kindness.  This process of expressing myself in this blog post has been therapeutic for me.  I have belittled myself a little more and exercised my demon a little more.  I pray that G-d helps me continue to carve-burn away the excess in this life so that I may be of better service to everyone.</p>
<h2 id="offending-and-protecting">Offending and Protecting</h2>
<p>Previously, I risked offending people when I used the word &ldquo;demon&rdquo; and then did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yojh8s_0ZBU">related talk with Tyler and Mr. Grizwald</a> which received a great response from Jacob Bunburry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the video, when you said you do not get offended, in the normal sense, do you mean that you don&rsquo;t experience self abacing (sp?) emotions when challenged?  I suppose the word Offend might be divvied up some more. As it can mean how I feel when I get cursed by an angry person on the highway while driving safely with a young and innocent child in the car. Or it could refer to that competitive feeling just before returning a clever bit of sarcasm to a good friend who&rsquo;s playfully giving me a hard time about something. Though created from the same emotion, they are different enough to nearly be unrecognizable as kin. I suppose the question to have been asked in the video to all would have been, &ldquo;what are you protecting?&rdquo; Perhaps the definition of Demon you had was a well thought out idea you felt needed justified. And perhaps Griz has come in contact with a personal distaste for the word that could have been fleshed out some more&hellip;.
Just some thoughts. Heh, yeah, &ldquo;frenetic whirligig&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am going to equate self abasing with &ldquo;belittling&rdquo;.  I do experience belittling emotions when I identify the mistake(s) I am making.  But this is very rare at this point in my life.  I actually miss the feeling of being belittled because it corresponds with my self improvement.  When I am challenged, I seek the feeling of being belittled.  I ask myself: is there something I need to carve away from who I am?  I am a very good student.  I am very coachable.</p>
<p>When the angry person curses me on the highway for no good reason I have to be careful to avoid assuming that there was no good reason.  Sometimes we are too quick to point the finger at someone else.  I ask myself: what did I do wrong?  But I get the point.  Sometimes people are angry at us without a good reason and that is their mistake.  Irrational anger is very scary to me.  But I use it to practice loving courageously.  Depending on the situation, I accept the confrontation while possessing the holy spirit.  I seek out learning what they perceive to be the mistake I made and being thankful that they were willing to share feedback with me.</p>
<p>I know the feeling of doing sarcasm when a good friend is playfully giving me a hard time.  I know that feeling of avoiding identifying the mistake and missing an opportunity to carve off a little bit more of who I am.  The sarcasm isn&rsquo;t always bad because the friend probably has something they can carve away as well.  We can always learn a better way of receiving and giving feedback.</p>
<p>I really do love this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you protecting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect Griz was trying to protect a person or some people from the suffering I might inflict.  Griz doubts my ability to help people grow and learn and transform towards the good.  And I am thankful to have Griz question my ability.  I know my aim is good.  But I also know that I can be impatient.  When I suggested that people should start a YouTube channel and have conversations on the internet, I was not being gentle-patient-kind.  The truth is that I have over 10 years of private recordings where I practiced and prepared.  For over 10 years, I have been working with teams of people solving difficult problems and transforming into a better person.  My own development has been slow and I pray I still have a long way to go because that&rsquo;s what it means to be human.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve honestly told people I am not neurotypical even though I have had no diagnosis.  But what happens in the mind of the person who believes I am not neurotypical?  When we learn that the other person is not neurotypical we are encouraged to be more forgiving of the other person&rsquo;s behaviors.  We update our expectations.  The risk is that we might disregard people who are not neurotypical.  I think we should practice treating everyone as if none of us are neurotypical.  Please let me know if you think I am wrong and why you think I am wrong.  All I need is a good reason.</p>
