<h1 id="matthew-7">Matthew 7</h1>
<p>Using this form of bible study, I was guided into a better belief and hopefully a better life.</p>
<h2 id="judging">Judging</h2>
<h6 id="judging-others">Judging Others</h6>
<blockquote>
<p>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can become stressed about our appearances and how others will perceive us because we interpret superficial appearances too quickly and with too much confidence and without curiousity.  This can be come part of our subconscious.</p>
<p>When we judge others as having lesser immature childish minds they will judge us as having lesser immature childish minds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not judge people by the way they look.</li>
<li>Other people should not judge you by the way you look.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&rsquo;s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We humans often belittle other people&rsquo;s work even when our own work is inferior.  This can become part of our subconscious.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be curious about the importance of people&rsquo;s work.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother&rsquo;s eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know how to cast motes out of other people&rsquo;s eyes yet.  I will practice by removing the beam from my own eye and addressing my mistaken subconscious views.  I am reminded of Thich Nhat Hanh saying all views are wrong views.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Know what is holy.  The most sacred thing I know is children and the holy intent to mature the childish mind within myself.  I can then be of better service to others, including my wife and children.</p>
<h2 id="self-control">Self Control</h2>
<h6 id="prayer-and-the-golden-rule">Prayer and the Golden Rule</h6>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give your attention to the greatest intentions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could have peace on Earth if people focused their attention on that intention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We act in evil ways and we have the opportunity to act in good ways if we seek help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to be respected and therefore I must respect others.  Viewing others as having childish minds will cause them to view me as having a childish mind.  Children are holy and sacred.  We are all children.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-and-wrong-way">The Right and Wrong Way</h2>
<h6 id="the-narrow-and-wide-gates">The Narrow and Wide Gates</h6>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of identifying various doors and thinking about the consequences of choosing one door over another is important.  Most people step through a door too quickly.  When I was a child, I had stepped through many doors: believing in the first story I encountered from others or the first story I imagined as a response to others.  I practice retreating from the path I had chosen and treading more carefully with each step.</p>
<h2 id="the-deceptive-wolves">The Deceptive Wolves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no sheep.  We are all immature childish monsters.  If we try, we can learn to better serve the greatest intentions.</p>
<p>Who brings forth good fruit?</p>
<ul>
<li>The servants: who serve the Greatest Intentions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who brings forth evil fruit?</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who kill the servants.</li>
<li>Those who steal the lives of the servants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who brings forth no fruit?</p>
<ul>
<li>The hermits: who merely consume.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="withstanding-the-storm">Withstanding the Storm</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last night I dreamed of a flood.  Everything was wonderful.  My children and I had caught some enormous fish.  But the flood came and took the fish and then the boat keys and then the boat.  Some family and friends came to help and fortunately no people were lost in the flood.</p>
